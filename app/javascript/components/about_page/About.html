<h2>Welcome to Elicit.</h2>


<p>Elicit is an online platform designed for researchers to carry out online human subject experiments in the web
  browser. The project is mainly driven by researchers in collaboration with professional programmers that implement
  and expand the. It has been used to carry out several experiments and has now had over 1000 participant pass
  through.
  The platform is comprised of three parts,</p>
<ol>
  <li>A frontend that visualize stimuli, captures user responses and interactions using scales and webcam eye tracking
    in the browser.
  </li>
  <li> An API that interacts with the database where user responses, behavioral data and interactions are stored for
    easy retrieval. A data model has been created that conceptually makes it easy to distinguish definition and results
    structure along with roles of each user (anonymized or registered).
  </li>
  <li>A client-side API (python) that allows researchers to both create and extract results from experiments.</li>
</ol>
<p>To start creating experiments using this platform you would have to have basic knowledge about programming in
  Python as all interaction using the client-side API is in python. Otherwise, there is no need to know any other
  programming languages.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the technical side of the platform, please visit

<p>The platform was initially started at the Technical University of Denmark under the CoSound project. The focus was
  to carry out listening experiments, but the platform has since been expanded greatly using various funding sources
  and is now continued at the City College of New York. Investigators can now capture not only user responses through
  several scales but also capture eye movements using the WebGazer plugin.</p>
<p>The project is led by postdoc Jens Madsen and programmer Iain Bryson from Freeroaming solutions. For any technical
  questions, please contact Iain Bryson for any questions regarding collaboration please contact Jens Madsen. We are
  eager to put the platform to use and expand its capabilities, so letâ€™s hear your feedback and ideas.</p>
