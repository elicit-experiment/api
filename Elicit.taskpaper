Fixes Nov 28:
- I think on the participant page (https://elicit.compute.dtu.dk/participant), the wording should be ‘you are eligible to participate in x experiments.’ Don’t use protocol here, I think it will confuse. @done
- Experiment: #9 — Learning Study Protocol: Take protocol should be renamed to ‘Participate’. @done
- The summary text is not aligned. @done
- Status: "You already participated in this experiment, and it does not allow any more participations." @done
- Prevent users from proceeding without hitting a threshold of calibration @done
- In the Webgazer help box that pops up, I think we should remove the close button and only allow people to calibrate. @done
- The radio button groups wraps text so that it is under the button instead of only under the text field. It is a subtle thing. @done
- Options the user selected. timestamp x @done
- Have dump results iterate through the participants who provided results to the study. @done
- 
- Return exact length of video -- timestamp when it stops. @done
- Multiple file CSV example. @done
- Prevent users from restarting/continuing a quiz once they leave; add an error message @done
- Add ability to create TrialOrders without a ProtocolUser @done
- Add Randomized TrialOrders, and ability to bind TrialOrder to ProtocolUser at take time @done
- Query example: "Give me all eye tracking for each video". @done

- Have you tried to see what happens when people to not have a webcam? Or they don’t allow access, then it fails? @done
- HTTP support @done
- Landing page for mechanical turk (create seprate page, automatically log in and assign new user when quiz is taken from there) @done
- Update the 'normal' home page. @done
- Provide video coodinates. @done

- Prevent users from pausing or going back in the video or stopping. @done
- Fix duplicate events @done
- Update to new object creation code idiom in build_study.py @done

- Change the output for answers.csv to "The actual text of the response and the ID (compared to the input questions, i.e. options are 1. The sky is blue, 2. The sky is red, 3, the sky is black, presented to the user in order 2 3 1, the user chooses The sky is blue. When the answer is returned then then option 1, The sky is blue is returned.)"
- Break out the layout into layouts.csv with the geometry as columns, plus experiment_id, phase_definition_id, trial_definition_id, component_id, time, user_id
- Create trial_events.csv as "A dump of all timestamps on the experiment level (when did the user start and end the experiment, phase level, when did they start/stop a phase and on the trial level, when was a trial started and ended."
- Dump all "address" info (experiment_id, phase_definition_id, trial_definition_id, component_id) in video.csv
- [Low Priority] Have the library code handle the json.dumps

- [bug fix] experiment results doesn't always have created_at and completed_at

- Anonymous user post-experiment landing page
- Support for adding a hidden "MTurk token" to post-experiment landing page
- Double check formatting codes work: "Also a small bug: In the Summary text field describing a protocol. I can see in your scrip that you insert a number of \n however it seems these are ignored. Maybe the frontend uses different notation for the next line symbol."
- [Low Priority, Try] to get phase_definition_id, trial_definition_id included in webgazer.csv
- [Low Priority] Layout on all components

- CSS -> lines sticking out @done(2017-12-01)
- OneDScale -> doesn’t show something when you press on the 1D scale; was a circle now a square; Position in the metadata is not defined, then no marker. If marker is defined, it’s already positioned. @done(2017-12-01)

Verify all components:
- Investigate JSON schema


Issues:
